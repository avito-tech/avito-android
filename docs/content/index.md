# Android in Avito

Multiple projects live in two repositories:

- Open Source repository ([avito-tech/avito-android](https://github.com/avito-tech/avito-android)) - monorepo of all tooling to continuously test and deliver apps to users.
- Internal repository (closed source) - monorepo of all apps and shared libraries

???+ info
    You could see links to "internal" resources that are not available for non-employees (links.k.avito.ru).  
    It has been done on purpose to have single documentation and show the whole picture.

???+ info
    There is another part of documentation that is not published yet.  
    You can find the old version [in history](https://github.com/avito-tech/avito-android/tree/a96e3d62e7540dcc5314cd8029ad28ff3a3b1e59/docs/content/docs).
